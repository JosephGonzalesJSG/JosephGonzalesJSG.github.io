# The Starbucks Latte Index

Have you ever wondered if your dollar can buy you a coffee no matter what country you are in? Have you ever wondered if you’re actually getting your money’s worth when you buy goods in other countries? 

Purchasing power parity can help you answer these questions. It measures the differences in price levels between countries in that country’s currency. It helps you find an exchange rate based on price levels, which may be lower or higher than the nominal exchange rate set by the Bank of Canada. This means that you could possibly buy a coffee in another country cheaper than what you can buy in Canada.

To understand this, we have created a Starbucks Tall Latte Index which shows the different prices of the tall latte in different countries.
